## Built with

- vite(React + Typescript)

  ```shell
  $ npm create vite@latest $project_name --template react-ts
  ```

- Tailwind Css
- React Router

### What I learned

`rafce` short cut to init a React functional component

```shell

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

#tailwindcss configuration
content: [ "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"]

#For the smallest possible production build, we recommend minifying your CSS with a tool like cssnano, and compressing your CSS with Brotli.
#If youâ€™re using Tailwind CLI, you can minify your CSS by adding the --minify flag:
npx tailwindcss -o build.css --minify
```

`npm run build` run production use, but load a white page index with `css` and `js`file missing ;

- It turns out you need to set basename path in `react-router-dom` and also in `vite config file` when deploy it to a github repo. It seems a bit late to learn that github pages really enable user to put multiple project, though so far they are all pure static websites.

Question:

- background image position issues , can't put it in the right place.
- mix blend mode for display the button and the text color
  - fix it by using the `rgba(r,g,b, opcacity)`,seperate the text from background color
- calulate the sibling element's height and set its margin top to negative value
  - fix it by setting background image container to `position:absolute ` and its parent element to `position:relative`
- Pro plan background image position (same with sign up form background image)

  - `backgroud position` and `background size`

- How to set the text color(`span`) inside a `select` `option`

- form validation

  - Useful article :[How to type a React form onSubmit handler](https://epicreact.dev/how-to-type-a-react-form-on-submit-handler/)

  ```javascript
  //custom interface for FormElements
  interface FormElements extends HTMLFormControlsCollection {
    name: HTMLInputElement,
    email: HTMLInputElement,
    plan: HTMLSelectElement,
    phoneNo: HTMLInputElement,
    company: HTMLInputElement,
  }

  interface CustomFormElements extends HTMLFormElement {
    readonly elements: FormElements
  }


  ```

  - simple email validation pattern: `/^\S+@\S+$/g`

  - Deploy to Github Pages with white loading index page - unsolve problem

## TO DO NEXT

- custom-styled select form control in the sign-up form
- live countdown timer

## One more thing
